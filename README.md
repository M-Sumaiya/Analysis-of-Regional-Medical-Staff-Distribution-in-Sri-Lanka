### Analysis of Regional Medical Staff Distribution in Sri Lanka

This project examines the disparities in the distribution of medical staff across different regions of Sri Lanka. Using datasets from the Ministry of Health and the Department of Census and Statistics, it evaluates regional healthcare accessibility and identifies gaps in medical staffing relative to international standards. Key components of the analysis include:

- **Data Collection and Preparation**: Combining healthcare workforce and population datasets to analyze staffing patterns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing population distribution, medical officer allocation, and regional correlations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employing the Shapiro-Wilk and Friedman tests to identify staffing disparities.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarking against WHO standards to highlight under-resourced regions.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Created in Power BI, allowing stakeholders to explore data through filters, charts, and maps for actionable insights.

The findings aim to assist policymakers in addressing healthcare inequities, focusing on regions most affected by staff shortages to improve service accessibility and public health outcomes.
